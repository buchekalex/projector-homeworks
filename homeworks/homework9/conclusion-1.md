## Analysis

The analysis compares the performance of select queries on the `users` table with different indexing strategies. The three scenarios analyzed are without index, with a B-tree index on the date of birth, and with a hash index on the date of birth. Here are the key findings:

### Without Index

- **Type:** All rows are scanned (`ALL`), indicating no index was used.
- **Rows Scanned:** 40,000,000
- **Filter Efficiency:** 0.01%

### With B-tree Index

- **Type:** A reference (`ref`) to the B-tree index on the date of birth (`idx_date_of_birth`) was used.
- **Rows Scanned:** 3,588
- **Filter Efficiency:** 100%

### With Hash Index

- **Type:** A reference (`ref`) to the hash index on the date of birth (`idx_hash_date_of_birth`) was used.
- **Rows Scanned:** 3,494
- **Filter Efficiency:** 100%

## Conclusion

The results clearly show the impact of indexing on the performance of select queries. Utilizing either a B-tree or hash index on the date of birth field significantly reduced the number of rows scanned, leading to much more efficient query execution.

The comparison between B-tree and hash index indicates a similar performance level in this specific scenario, with a minor difference in the number of rows scanned. However, the choice between the two may depend on other factors like storage space, specific query patterns, and the nature of the data.

In contrast, without an index, the query has to scan the entire table of 40 million rows, leading to poor efficiency. This demonstrates the importance of indexing, especially in large tables, to achieve efficient query execution and optimization.

It's advised to consider the specific use cases, query patterns, and data distribution when deciding between different indexing strategies to ensure optimal performance.
